##Plans for bikeshare project kickoff:

### What is kaggle? 
* Ryan and maybe Paul and maybe this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoD84TVdD-4#t=31

### Pitch the challenge
* Adventure!
* Empowering statement "You may not realize it yet, but you actually have enough knowledge/skill to DoML!"
* DoML, from start to finish, and iterate

###Teamsort: How much effort are you willing to put into this outside of meeting time?
* Write down a number of how many hours (approx) you'd spend outside of co-currciular time
* Then, go to that part of the room
* Pick a partner from that part of the room
* Try to get teams of 2, ... avoid 3 if you can

###First note to everyone:
* Given the problem and features, what do you expect the data to be like? Discuss with your partner. :)
* What are two features that have the highest correlation. Plot it in the data. Was your intuition confirmed or denied?
* Then, get to know your data. Plot something!
* Come up with a few different ways to compare data points and look at trends.
* Questions + work plan should be done without computers
