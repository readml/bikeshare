##Plans for bikeshare project kickoff:

### What is kaggle? 
* Ryan and maybe Paul and maybe this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoD84TVdD-4#t=31

### Pitch the challenge
* Adventure!
* Empowering statement "You may not realize it yet, but you actually have enough knowledge/skill to DoML!"
* DoML, from start to finish, and iterate

###Teamsort: How much effort are you willing to put into this outside of meeting time?
* Write down a number of how many hours (approx) you'd spend outside of co-currciular time K
* Then, go to that part of the room
* Pick a partner from that part of the room
* Try to get teams of 2, ... avoid 3 if you can

###First note to everyone:
* Given the problem and features, what do you expect the data to be like? Discuss with your partner. :) (go to the whiteboards; no computers yet)
* What are two features that have the highest correlation. Plot it in the data. Was your intuition confirmed or denied?
* Come up with a few different ways to compare data points and look at trends.

###Culture of the group:
* Don't provide too much definition on what to do... If they ask us and want to discuss the options, let's discuss! Otherwise, explore in a freestyle fashion.
* Take ownership of your project and have fun with it. :)
* At the end: Everyone shares the cool stuff they did! :D celebrate it
* Keep tabs / check-in on groups. Every week: sign up on the board to discuss/get help?
